# The Last Samurai

One hundred Samurai are standing in a circle each holding a sword. The first samurai kills the second, then the third kills the forth, and so on until there is only one Samurai left standing.

Write a program to determine which Samurai will be the last one alive (assume we have numbered the samurai from 1 to 100)?

## Hints

One strategy is to use an `Array` to store the 100 Samurai and remove a Samurai once it is killed. Continue until the array length is equal to 1.
